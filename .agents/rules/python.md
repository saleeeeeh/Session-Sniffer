# Python Development Rules

## Version and Tooling

* The project requires Python 3.14.
* `pyproject.toml` is authoritative for Python version, dependencies, formatting, linting, type checking, and static-analysis configuration.
* Follow the existing project tooling. Do not introduce competing formatters, linters, or type checkers.
* Preserve the existing suppression and configuration lists unless the task explicitly requires changing them.
* The project targets a line length of 176 characters.

## Project Imports

* The repository uses a `src` layout.
* Import project modules as `from session_sniffer...`.
* Never import project modules as `from src.session_sniffer...`.

## Style

* Use single quotes for strings throughout the project. Use double quotes only when the string itself contains a single quote.
* Never use `from __future__ import annotations`.
* Never use quoted forward references in type hints.
* Use precise type hints and prefer existing project types, protocols, models, and type aliases.
* Use descriptive variable names. Do not use abbreviations such as `res`, `net`, `ips`, `conn`, `msg`, or `err`.
* Single-letter variables are reserved for `i` and `j` as loop indices, and `e` for exception handling.
* Access attributes and functions directly; only use local aliases when necessary to preserve a value across changing state.

## Pluralization

* Never use parenthesized plural patterns such as `username(s)`, `IP(s)`, or `file(s)` in user-facing strings, messages, dialogs, action labels, or tooltips whenever a count is available or can be determined.
* Always use `pluralize(count)` from `session_sniffer.text_utils` (e.g. `f'username{pluralize(count)}'`, `f'IP{pluralize(count)}'`) to dynamically format singular and plural forms.

## Documentation Style

* In comments and docstrings, use single backticks for inline code.
* Never use RST double backticks for inline code.

## Exceptions and Error Handling

* Do not add defensive `try/except` blocks merely to prevent crashes.
* Only catch exceptions that are documented or known to be raised by the operation being performed.
* Never broadly catch unexpected internal failures with `except Exception`.
* Prefer a clear traceback over silently swallowing unexpected errors.
* Never use `assert` for runtime validation. Raise an appropriate exception such as `ValueError` or `RuntimeError`.

## Performance and Concurrency

* Do not perform blocking or high-latency operations in packet callbacks.
* Offload expensive or blocking work using the project's existing threading architecture.
* Preserve existing concurrency, worker, queue, and synchronization patterns.
* Do not introduce unnecessary allocations, repeated parsing, or expensive work into hot paths without a demonstrated need.

## Thread Exceptions

* Preserve the project's `threading.excepthook` handling in `src/session_sniffer/core/control.py` for uncaught thread exceptions.
* Do not replace or bypass the existing thread exception handling mechanism without an explicit reason.

## Logging

* Use `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` in every module that needs a logger. Do not import or call any project-specific logger shim.
* `setup_logging()` is called once at application startup in `main.py`. Do not call it from library modules or module-level code outside `main.py`.
* Prefer the existing logger methods — `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `exception` — over `print`.
* Use terminal output only for intentional console reporting.
* Choose log severity deliberately:
  * `debug` — expected, low-value operational noise (e.g. DNS timeouts, cache misses).
  * `warning` — something went wrong and could explain a user-visible problem, but the full traceback adds no value (`logger.warning('…: %s', e)`).
  * `exception` — an unexpected failure on a critical path where the full traceback is diagnostic (`logger.exception('…')`). Use this inside `except` blocks where you want the traceback captured.
* Do not silently swallow exceptions; prefer a clear traceback over `except ...: pass`.

## Dependencies

Before adding a dependency:

* Check whether the functionality already exists in the project or standard library.
* Inspect `pyproject.toml`.
* Keep new dependencies to a minimum.
* Pin new dependencies exactly to match the project's existing dependency style, except security libraries which may use `>=` when appropriate.

## General Python Changes

Prefer clear, explicit, maintainable Python over clever abstractions or metaprogramming.

Fix the underlying problem rather than suppressing a diagnostic or weakening type checking to make the code pass.

## File Sizing and Structural Warnings

* Do not artificially fragment cohesive files just to satisfy metric-based linter warnings like `too-many-lines`.
* **Genuine exceptions (leave as-is)**: Keep files unified and retain existing `# pylint: disable=too-many-lines` when the high line count is inherent to the file's purpose:
  * Declarative data / lookup tables (e.g. `src/session_sniffer/networking/third_party_servers_ranges.py`);
  * Centralized configuration schemas / models (e.g. `src/session_sniffer/models/settings_ini_model.py`);
  * Configuration defaults registries (e.g. `src/session_sniffer/settings/defaults.py`);
  * Standalone developer / diagnostic scripts (e.g. `.dev/verify_ranges.py`).
* Real refactoring (such as extracting mixins or helper modules) should be reserved for components with separable concerns (such as complex GUI classes or bloated controllers), not declarative datasets or unified schema models.
