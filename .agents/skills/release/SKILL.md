# Session Sniffer Release

Use this skill when the user wants to prepare and commit a new Session Sniffer release or release candidate.

## Release Procedure

1. Inspect the Git working tree before making changes.
2. Do not modify or discard unrelated user changes.
3. Read the current `version` from `pyproject.toml`.
4. Check whether the current version has already been published/tagged on GitHub (`git ls-remote --tags origin` or local tags matching the version prefix):
   - If NOT tagged/published on GitHub: do NOT increment the RC or version number; only update the build timestamp.
   - If ALREADY tagged/published on GitHub: ask the user whether this is a new release candidate (`RC`) or a final release.
5. Generate the current UTC timestamp in the format:
   - build timestamp: `YYYYMMDD.HHMM`
   - full UTC timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
6. Update the `version` in `pyproject.toml`:
   - If unpublished: preserve the existing version prefix (e.g. `v1.5.0rc.69`) and update only the build timestamp.
   - For a new RC: increment the existing `rc.N` number by one, preserving `X.Y.Z`.
   - For a final release: remove the `rc.N` suffix, preserving `X.Y.Z`.
   - Always append the new UTC build timestamp: `+YYYYMMDD.HHMM`
10. Synchronize `uv.lock` immediately:
    - Run `uv lock` to rebuild/update the `session-sniffer` version in `uv.lock`.
    - Enforce CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings on `uv.lock` (since `uv` outputs LF line endings by default).
    - Run `uv lock --check` to verify the lockfile is completely synchronized.
11. Review the resulting diff (both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` should reflect the new version).
12. Run the relevant project validation before committing.
13. Verify CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings on all modified files, especially `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.
14. Show the user:
    - previous version,
    - new version,
    - changed files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`),
    - validation performed.
15. Create exactly one version-bump commit containing both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` using:

   `build: bump version to <new-version>`

16. Ensure the version-bump commit is pushed before creating any GitHub tag or release. The release tag MUST match `version` in `pyproject.toml` exactly.
17. Do not amend, reset, rebase, force-push, or otherwise rewrite Git history.

## Version Format

The expected version format is:

`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+YYYYMMDD.HHMM`

or for release candidates:

`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCHrc.N+YYYYMMDD.HHMM`

Examples:

`v1.5.0rc.45+20260909.2017`

`v1.5.0+20260909.2017`

## Unpublished / Untagged Releases

If the current version in `pyproject.toml` has not been published or tagged on GitHub (e.g. no remote tag exists matching the current version prefix, such as `v1.5.0rc.69`):
- Do NOT increment the version number or `rc.N` number.
- Retain the exact existing version prefix.
- Only update the UTC build timestamp (`+YYYYMMDD.HHMM`).

For example, if the current version is:

`v1.5.0rc.69+20260929.0504`

and `rc.69` was never tagged or published on GitHub, the next build timestamp update becomes:

`v1.5.0rc.69+<current UTC timestamp>`

## RC Releases

If the current version is:

`v1.5.0rc.44+20260908.1641`

the next RC must become:

`v1.5.0rc.45+<current UTC timestamp>`

Do not reuse the previous timestamp.

## Final Releases

If the current version is:

`v1.5.0rc.45+20260909.2017`

a final release of version `1.5.0` becomes:

`v1.5.0+<current UTC timestamp>`

Do not retain the `rc.N` suffix.

If the user intends a different `X.Y.Z` final version, confirm that version before changing the file.

## Commit

The commit subject must be:

`build: bump version to <new-version>`

For example:

`build: bump version to v1.5.0rc.45+20260909.2017`

The version-bump commit should contain only the intended release-version changes in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Never commit a release version bump without its synchronized `uv.lock`.

Do not create a commit if validation fails.

## Validation

Use the project's existing validation configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

For a version-only change, use the smallest relevant validation available:
- Run `uv lock --check` to ensure `uv.lock` is strictly up to date.
- Verify CRLF (`\r\n`) line endings on both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

If dependencies, resources, packaging configuration, or other release-sensitive files are also changed, broaden validation appropriately.

Never claim validation was performed unless it was actually performed.

## Important

The version timestamp represents the current UTC time.

Do not use local time.

Do not manually invent or reuse a timestamp.

Do not silently change unrelated files.

Do not automatically push the commit.
